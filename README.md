# ðŸŒ¼Daisy PortfolioðŸŒ¼

Daisy Portfolio is my full-stack portfolio app that started as a fun challenge after building my first Next.js project. I learned a lot about the App Router, but then thought, what if I donâ€™t even need multiple routes? What if I could just switch components on a single route, kind of like how macOS apps work?

Since I'm super comfortable using a Mac, I decided to recreate that vibe in a web app! Itâ€™s designed to feel like a native desktop experience, all running on a single route with dynamic component rendering.
